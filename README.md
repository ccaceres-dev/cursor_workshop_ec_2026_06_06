# MarketLab

MarketLab is a Cursor workshop starter: a fake-money prediction market UI built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn-style primitives, and hosted Supabase.

The repo intentionally starts with static fictional markets and no committed database schema or seed SQL. During the workshop, use the prompt in `prompts/01-build-marketlab.md` with Supabase MCP to generate auth, tables, storage, RLS, RPC functions, and seed data.

## Stack

- Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS and shadcn-style UI primitives
- Supabase Auth, Postgres, Storage, RLS, and RPC
- Zod, Vitest, Playwright, Biome, Bun

## Prerequisites

Install `mise` before starting: [Installing Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html).

This project uses `mise` to install the pinned workshop tools, including Node.js, Bun, the GitHub CLI, and Task. Task is the workshop command runner; see the official [Task docs](https://taskfile.dev/docs/installation) for reference, but you do not need to install it separately when using `mise`.

## Setup

Clone the repo, trust the project `mise` config, install tools, and set up dependencies:

```bash
mise trust
mise install
task setup
```

Create a hosted Supabase project for the workshop. In the Supabase dashboard, copy the project URL, anon key, and project ref into `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=
```

For workshop speed, go to **Authentication > Sign In / Providers > Email** and turn off **Confirm email**.

Start the static starter and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
task dev
```

You should see static demo markets and read-only market detail pages.

## Workshop Build

Open `prompts/01-build-marketlab.md` in Cursor and run it with Supabase MCP enabled. That prompt should generate the Supabase migration and seed files, then wire the static starter into live Auth, Database, Storage, RLS, RPC, and Server Actions.

If the Supabase CLI asks you to authenticate first, run:

```bash
task db:login
```

After the prompt creates the Supabase artifacts, link the repo and apply the generated migrations and seed data:

```bash
task db:link
task db:push
task db:types
```

Verify the finished workshop app:

```bash
task verify
task e2e
```

## Commands

Run project commands through Task:

```bash
task --list
```
